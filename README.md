This was supposed to become a Java/postgresql program to schedule employees

I copy/pasted a java calendar program,
discussed with my "client" the specifications.
Then I changed some parts of the calendar to fit my clients requirements
and connected it with a postgresql database.
My calendar had a direct connection to the database.
For this reason I consider this project a success.

This project stopped developing further because of a decision making process.
I couldn't figure out if it would be better to rewrite the code with an existing Excel Java API,
(to make it as useful as an Excel sheet)
or continue to work on my existing code and use plain java .
