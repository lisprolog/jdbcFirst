This was supposed to become a Java/postgresql program to schedule employees

I copy/pasted a java calendar program,
discussed with my "client" the specifications.
Then I changed some parts of the calendar to fit my clients requirements
and connected it with a postgresql database.
My calendar had a direct connection to the database.

Update: Apache POI Excel successfully tested.
Project in development
